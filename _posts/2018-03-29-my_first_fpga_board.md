I've just received my first FPGA devboard.

It looks like it's a clone of the LambdaConcept [LX16SDRAM](http://blog.lambdaconcept.com/doku.php?id=products:lx16sdram) board.

With help of this little board, I plan to enter the world of FPGA. I've just started lerning Verilog and Migen and now have a real hardware to play with.
