Most of the examples discussed in the [first]({{site.baseur}}/2018/03/30/go_on_very_small_hardware.html) and [second]({{site.baseur}}/2018/04/14/go_on_very_small_hardware2.html) part of this article are blinking LEDs in one or another way. It may have been interesting at first, but after a while it has become a bit boring. Let's do something more entertaining...

 ...let's light more LEDs!

## WS281x LEDs

The [WS281x](http://www.world-semi.com/solution/list-4-1.html) RGB LEDs (and their clones) are very popular. You can buy them as single elements, chained into long strips or assembled into matrices, rings or other form-factors.

![WS2812B]({{site.baseur}}/images/led/ws2812b.jpg)

They can be connected in series and thanks to this, you can control a long LED strip with only single pin of your MCU. Unfortunately, the phisical protocol used by their internal controller doesn't fit straight into any peripheral you can find in a MCU. You have to use bit-banging or use available peripherals in unusual way.

Which of the available solutions is the most efficient depends on the number of LED strips controlled at the same time. If you have to drive 4 to 16 strips the most efficient way is to [use timers and DMA](http://www.martinhubacek.cz/arm/improved-stm32-ws2812b-library) (don't overlook the links at the end of Martin's article).

If you have to control only one or two strips, use available SPI or UART peripherals. In case of SPI you can encode only two WS281x bits in one byte sent. UART allows more dense coding thanks to clever use of the start and stop bits: 3 bits per one byte sent.

The best explanation of how the UART protocol fits into WS281x protocol I found on [this site](http://mikrokontrolery.blogspot.com/2011/03/Diody-WS2812B-sterowanie-XMega-cz-2.html). If you can't read Polish, here is its [English translation](https://translate.google.pl/translate?sl=pl&tl=en&u=http://mikrokontrolery.blogspot.com/2011/03/Diody-WS2812B-sterowanie-XMega-cz-2.html).

## RGB clock

There are many examples of clocks built of RGB LEDs on the Intrnet. Let's build our own using STM32F030 board and this LED ring:

![WS2812B]({{site.baseur}}/images/led/rgbring.jpg)

It has 24 individually addressable RGB LEDs (WS2812B) and exposes four terminals: GND, 5V, DI and DO. You can chain more rings or other WS2812 based things by connecting DI (data in) terminal to the DO (data out) terminal of previous one.

We will use UART based driver so the DI should be connected to TxD pin on UART header. The LEDs can consume quite a lot of current so during programming/debuggin it's best to connect the GND and 5V terminals directly to the GND and 5V pins available on ST-LINK programmer:

![WS2812B]({{site.baseur}}/images/led/ring-stlink-f030.jpg)

Our STM32F030F4P6 MCU, and whole STM32F0, STM32F7, STM32L4 families, have one important thing that the STM32F1, STM32F4, STM32L1 MCUs don't have: it allows to invert UART signals and therefore we can connect this ring directly to the UART TxD pin. If you don't known that we need such inversion you probably didn't read the [article](https://translate.google.pl/translate?sl=pl&tl=en&u=http://mikrokontrolery.blogspot.com/2011/03/Diody-WS2812B-sterowanie-XMega-cz-2.html) I mentioned above.

So you can't use popular [Blue Pill](https://jeelabs.org/article/1649a/) or [STM32F4-DISCOVERY](http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32f4discovery.html) this way. Use their SPI peripheral or an external inverter (see [Christmas Tree Lights](https://github.com/ziutek/emgo/tree/master/egpath/src/stm32/examples/minidev/treelights) for more information).

Let's finish this lengthy introduction and go to the code. This time I will put the code and description in pieces.

Let's start with the *import* section:

```go
package main

import (
	"delay"
	"rtos"

	"led"
	"led/ws281x/wsuart"

	"stm32/hal/dma"
	"stm32/hal/gpio"
	"stm32/hal/irq"
	"stm32/hal/system"
	"stm32/hal/system/timer/systick"
	"stm32/hal/usart"
)
```

The only new thing compared to the previous examples is the *led* package with its *led/ws281x* subtree. Currently the *led* package itself contains only definition of *Color* type. I was wondering about *color* package outside the *led* tree or using *Color* or *RGBA* type from *image/color*. For now I ended with *led.Color* type but I'm not very happy about it. I was also wondering to define LED strip in the way that it will implement *image.Image* interface but because of *gamma correction* and big overhead of *image/draw* package I ended with simple `type Strip []Pixel`, so you can subslice it, use *range*, *copy* and many well known idioms.

There are also not so many novelties in the *init* function:

```go
var (
	tts *usart.Driver
	btn gpio.Pin
)

func init() {
	system.SetupPLL(8, 1, 48/8)
	systick.Setup(2e6)

	gpio.A.EnableClock(true)
	btn = gpio.A.Pin(4)
	tx := gpio.A.Pin(9)

	btn.Setup(&gpio.Config{Mode: gpio.In, Pull: gpio.PullUp})

	tx.Setup(&gpio.Config{Mode: gpio.Alt})
	tx.SetAltFunc(gpio.USART1_AF1)
	d := dma.DMA1
	d.EnableClock(true)

	// 1390 ns/WS2812bit = 3 * 463 ns/UARTbit -> BR = 3 * 1e9 ns/s / 1390 ns/bit

	tts = usart.NewDriver(usart.USART1, d.Channel(2, 0), nil, nil)
	tts.Periph().EnableClock(true)
	tts.Periph().SetBaudRate(3000000000 / 1390)
	tts.Periph().SetConf2(usart.TxInv) // STM32F0 need no external inverter.
	tts.Periph().Enable()
	tts.EnableTx()

	rtos.IRQ(irq.USART1).Enable()
	rtos.IRQ(irq.DMA1_Channel2_3).Enable()
}
```

The PA4 pin is used to set the clock. The `btn.Setup(&gpio.Config{Mode: gpio.In, Pull: gpio.PullUp})` configures it as input with internal pull-up resistor enabled. The PA4 pin is connected to the onboard LED but that doesn't hinder us. More important is that it's located next to the GND pin so we can use any metal object to set the clock.

As you can see the baudrate was changed from 115200 to 3000000000/1390 â‰ˆ 2158273 which corresponds to 1390 nanoseconds per WS2812 bit. The `SetConf2(usart.TxInv)` sets the TXINV bit in CR2 register to invert TxD signal.

The *main* function contains whole logic of our clock:

```go
func main() {
	var setClock, setSpeed int
	rgb := wsuart.GRB
	strip := make(wsuart.Strip, 24)
	for {
		hs := int(rtos.Nanosec() / 5e8) // Half-seconds elapsed since reset.
		hs += setClock

		hs %= 12 * 3600 * 2 // Half-seconds from the last 0:00 or 12:00.
		h := len(strip) * hs / (12 * 3600 * 2)

		hs %= 3600 * 2 // Half-second from the beginning of the current hour.
		m := len(strip) * hs / (3600 * 2)

		hs %= 60 * 2 // Half-second from the beginning of the current minute.
		s := len(strip) * hs / (60 * 2)

		hc := led.Color(0x550000)
		mc := led.Color(0x005500)
		sc := led.Color(0x000055)

		// Blend colors if the hands of the clock overlap.
		if h == m {
			hc |= mc
			mc = hc
		}
		if m == s {
			mc |= sc
			sc = mc
		}
		if s == h {
			sc |= hc
			hc = sc
		}

		strip.Clear()
		strip[h] = rgb.Pixel(hc)
		strip[m] = rgb.Pixel(mc)
		strip[s] = rgb.Pixel(sc)
		tts.Write(strip.Bytes())

		// Set colck.
		if btn.Load() == 0 {
			setClock += setSpeed
			i := 0
			for btn.Load() == 0 && i < 10 {
				delay.Millisec(20)
				i++
			}
			if i == 10 && setSpeed < 10*60*2 {
				setSpeed += 10
			}
			continue
		}
		setSpeed = 5
		delay.Millisec(50)
	}
}
```

The *rgb* variable is set to the color order used by WS2812 controller. This code works also with WS2811 controllers -- the only necessary change is set the color order to RGB. To tell the truth, the baudrate should also be changed but in practice the WS2811 works also with WS2812 timing.

The *strip* variable acts as a framebuffer.

As you can see, we use the *rtos.Nanosec* function instead of *time.New* to obtain the current time. This saves much of Flash but also reduces our clock to antique device that has no idea about days, months and years and worst of all it doesn't handle daylight saving changes.

Our ring has 24 LEDs, so the second hand can be presented with an accuracy of 2.5 s. To don't sacrifice this accuracy and get smooth operation we use half-second as base interval.

The red, green and blue colors are used respectively for hour, minute and second hands. This allows us to use simple *or* operation for color blending. There is a *Color.Blend* method that can blend arbitrary colors but we are low of Flash so we prefer simplest possible solution.

The `strip.Clear()` clears the whole framebuffer to the black color. Next we set the color of three selected pixels to display three clock hands. The `tts.Write(strip.Bytes())` sends the content of the framebuffer to the ring.

Then we have the code that reads the state of PA4 pin and adjust the clock. There is a simple debouncing implemented and acceleration when the "button" is held down.

The program is ened with the code that handles interrupts, the same as in the [UART example]({{site.baseur}}/2018/04/14/go_on_very_small_hardware2.html#uart):

```go
func ttsISR() {
	tts.ISR()
}

func ttsDMAISR() {
	tts.TxDMAISR()
}

//c:__attribute__((section(".ISRs")))
var ISRs = [...]func(){
	irq.USART1:          ttsISR,
	irq.DMA1_Channel2_3: ttsDMAISR,
}
```
